T-SQL is powerful declarative language that lets you:
- explore
- manipulate

As the complexity of your programs increase, so does the risk of errors occurring.

Example: Data Type Mismatch, Variables not containing expected values

If not managed correctly, these errors can cause your programs to stop running or to produced unexpected behaviours.

T-SQL error handling can help to raise errors intentionally and set up alerts to fire when errors occurs.

1) Raise errors using the RAISERROR statement.
2) Raise errors using the THROW statement.
3) Use the @@ERROR system variable
4) Create custom errors.
5) Create alerts that fire when errors occur.

Error can be generated in response to an event or failure at the system level, or you can generate application errors in T-SQL code.

Every errors is composed of the following elements:

- Error Number
- Error Message
- Severity
- State
- Procedure
- Line Number
